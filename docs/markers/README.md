# Ground Control Markers
This folder contains the two versions used to capture ground surface images
during the SnowEx Alaska 2022 and 2023 fall campaign. The number and the 
location for the markers were updated for the 2023 effort. Notable change was 
to add a central marker and control strips to assist in calculating accuracy:
* [2022 version](Markers.pdf)
* [2023 version](Markers_US-Letter.svg)

## Image processing
The Metashape [processing script](../../metashape/process-images.py) requires
a marker distance CSV, for which a sample is given with the 
[markers_distance_sample.csv](markers_distance_sample.csv).
